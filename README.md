# KPMG_Data_Analytics

This is the repository of Tasks that I completed while I was doing Virtual Internship in KPMG through The Forage.

The Dashboard answers the following Questions - 

1. What are the trends in the underlying data?
2. Which customer segment has the highest customer value?
3. What should be Sprocket Central Pty Ltd â€™s marketing and growth strategy?
4. What are customer preferences and propensity to purchase the products?
